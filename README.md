Chatbots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails. 

HR Support bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings an executive from the HR team in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it is contained in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the user to submit a query which then gets posted in a pre-configured team of experts who are help to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within their team itself. Additionally, the bot suggests links to recommended HR policies/questions by searching for pre-configured tags in the question. These tiles can also be found in the associated tab as a quick reference.
HR Support works well for light weight QnA and to provide quick support when launching new projects/initiatives in the organization.
